The python scripts are created to deal with the case that the desired information can be found only after inputting some key values in the search fields.
The situation is that I got a list of key values, and the website can show me the desired information if I input the key value one by one and click the search button. Last but most importantly, I need to write the desired information to a Excel file every time I get the desired result. So this Python scripts can do this simple task.
